#The Habit Engine
The Habit Engine is a client for the open source project HabitRPG.  I created the Habit Engine with the intention of building upon and extending the concept of HabitRPG as a motivational tool for self-improvement. 

It's currently just a client for habitRPG in the unity game engine, but I would one day like to add more engaging media elements that include story events, game events, or build events.  Ultimately I would like to create a sort of alternate reality that reacts to your actions in a procedurally generated sort of way.  Like playing a game or making a story as you go along your daily business, in a way that is interesting and engaging, and motivating.  The mundane would become the fantastic.

I want to use the best that modern media has to offer to empower people to change themselves and to change their own lives, instead of using that modern media as a means of escape.  By improving ourselves, we can improve the world.

To start developing on the habitengine, simply clone this code, clone [unityhttp](https://github.com/andyburke/UnityHTTP) into the "assets" folder,  Open the Habit Engine project folder with Unity 2.6 beta(or better) or unity 2.5.3(or better), open the "login.unity" scene and then run.

Alternatively you can use [uniweb](http://u3d.as/content/different-methods/uni-web/1Cw), instead of unityhttp.
